# Overview

Auth0 integrates with Active Directory/LDAP through the __Active Directory/LDAP Connector__ that you install in your network.

The __AD/LDAP Connector (1)__, is a bridge between your __Active Directory (2)__  and the __Auth0 Service (3)__. This bridge is necessary because AD is typically locked down to your internal network, and Auth0 is a cloud service running on a completely different context.
