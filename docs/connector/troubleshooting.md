# Throubleshooting

We do our best to support many scenarios and different configurations.

Unfortunately some issues are very hard to predict. Especially those that happen behind our customer's firewall. We have less control over that environment, and the related infrastructure dependencies (e.g. network, proxies, OS versions, etc).

If you are experiencing problems with the connector send us the logs files to [support](mailto:support@auth0.com):

Windows: **C:\Program Files (x86)\Auth0\AD LDAP Connector\logs.log**
Linux: **/var/log/auth0-adldap.log**

We do not track any information automatically.
