Connecting with __Active Directory__ or any other __LDAP__ server with Auth0 usually involves deploying and running a piece of software on your side.

When prompted for the ticket url, paste the ticket url provided when you created the connection (if you don't have it handy, you can find it on the dashboard, by clicking on Setup on the connection).

You will need to provide the parameters to connect the connector to your LDAP.
