# Using Auth0 in Firebase APIs

As with any other add-on API enabled in the dahsboard, Auth0 will issue a Firebase token through the [Delegation](/auth-api#delegated) endpoint. This allows you to exchange a token for another one.

Please enable `Firebase API` from <a href="@@uiAppAddonsURL@@" target="_new">Application Add-ons</a> section and follow the instructions displayed.
