## Socket.io Tutorial

When using Realtime frameworks, Authentication is something extremely important. If we don't handle it correctly, a malicious user could hijack our stream and get and send any information he'd want.

In order to avoid that, you can configure Socket.io to work with JWT and particularly with Auth0.

### Instructions

For more information about it, you can [check out this blog post](https://auth0.com/blog/2014/01/15/auth-with-socket-io/) and see [a real sample on Github](https://github.com/auth0/socketio-jwt/tree/master/example)
